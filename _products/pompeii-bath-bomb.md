long_description: Scented with therapeutic grade Rose essential oil and activated charcoal. The Pompeii is the perfect day time or night time relaxation bomb. Natural sodium bicarbonate + epsom salt relieve inflammation of achy muscles and joints while activated charcoal binds to toxins in our pores and pulls it out- since we come into contact with environmental toxins and chemicals in our everyday living, this bomb is the perfect remedy. Topped with Rose petals and Jasmine buds. Beware of black bath water.
