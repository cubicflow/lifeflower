product-notes:

history: Clear Quartz crystals are said to be supreme gift of Mother Earth. Since it can be found on every continent of the earth, many cultures had different uses and beliefs behind this powerful crystal. Indigenous North American cultures thought of the stone as a sentient being, and would gift it offerings as a sign of respect. To cultures in Central and South America, the quartz meaning was that of a vessel, they believed that the spirits of their ancestors were held in clear quartz.

healing-properties: Clear Quartz encourages clarity of thought and purpose to one’s heart and mind. It works on all levels of the energetic and physical bodies and resonates with all chakras. Clear Quartz will amplify any energy with which it moves into resonance, including other stones, constantly broadcasting that energy into the Earths electromagnetic field. This makes Clear Quartz an excellent stone to use for programming, manifesting/meditation.
