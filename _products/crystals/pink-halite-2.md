history: Clear Quartz crystals are said to be supreme gift of Mother Earth. Since it can be found on every continent of the earth, many cultures had different uses and beliefs behind this powerful crystal. Indigenous North American cultures thought of the stone as a sentient being, and would gift it offerings as a sign of respect. To cultures in Central and South America, the quartz meaning was that of a vessel, they believed that the spirits of their ancestors were held in clear quartz.

healing-properties: Halite is a rock salt known for it’s cleansing and purifying properties, it aids in clarifying energy blocks and balancing energy fields. This makes it perfect for cleansing your other crystals! Similar to Selenite, you can rest your other crystals on it to remove unwanted/negative energies. In meditation, Pink Halite connects to the heart and solar plexus chakras allowing a self-loving awareness which aids in the release of emotional issues and attachments.
